# Introduction
You're probably looking for samples of my work. Since some of it would be
better suited with an explanation and some of it isn't even on Github, I've
tried to compile a summary here of projects I've worked on.

This was a web-application that was used to digitize paperwork into easy to use
input forms. The sole purpose of the website was to provide disaster case

disasters. I was primarily involved the front-end of the entire application
while developing some of the backend code in node.js.
