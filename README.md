# Introduction
You're probably looking for samples of my work. Since some of it would be
better suited with an explanation and some of it isn't even on Github, I've
tried to compile a summary here of projects I've worked on.

RentHackr is Glassdoor.com for real estate. Leveraging crowdsourced real
estate data, RentHackr presents users with objective and subjective
apartment reviews to create a marketplace.

Created a RESTful API that returned apartment data that met certain
criteria such as amenities or bedroom number in JSON. Lead and planned a
complete re-organization of the application's client-side code. Was
involved in split tests and user testing in order to measure metrics and
record user behavior. Added a test framework (Rspec), worked with third
party API's such as Instagram and facebook, and performed various other
tasks.

Used the following technologies:
- HTML / CSS
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Mapbox
- Coffeescript
- Leaflet.js
- Javascript
- Sass
